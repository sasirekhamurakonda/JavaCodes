TLC Systems presents a talk on Bitcoin and Blockchain
technologies, on 28 June, at the Larsen & Toubro Auditorium,
Lonavala.

Bitcoin is an interesting new cryptocurrency - a technology that
allows anonymous but fully secure and fully decentralized "cash"
transactions. If you have been paying attention either in the
finance technology industry or the startup funding scene, you'll
know that Bitcoin is getting a lot of hype, and even some of the
most conservative technology companies, like Deutsche Bank and
Barclays.
